Building Documentation
======================

The main documentation and Python documentation is written in
`reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ and
generated by `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_. The C++ API documentation
is generated by `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.nl/>`_ with help from breathe/exhale plugins.
We also include the ability to write documentation in markdown or by using juypter notebooks.
